If all target reps completed with controlled form  → Increase load by 2.5–5%
If last reps were grindy/slow → Repeat same weight next session
If fail target reps twice → Deload 10–15% then rebuild
If stall persists 3+ sessions → swap variation or rep range
Warm-up sets: 2–3 (light → moderate)
Working sets: 3–5 depending on exercise
Stop 1–2 reps before failure unless final set AMRAP
Tempo guideline: controlled eccentrics (2–3s), explosive concentric
Primary movement first (compound)
Secondary movement (compound or heavy accessory)
Isolation accessories last
Protein: 1.6–2.2g per kg bodyweight
Fats: 0.8–1g per kg bodyweight
Carbs: remainder of calories
If bodyweight dropping >1% per week → +150 to +250 kcal
If no change for 2 weeks while cutting → -100 to -200 kcal
If strength is regressing on bulk → increase carbs
If hunger extreme on cut → add protein or fiber first, not carbs
Cut: 10–15% below TDEE
Recomp: around TDEE, high protein
Bulk: 10–15% above TDEE (clean surplus)
Feeling fresh → assign normal progression
Minor fatigue → keep weight, reduce volume by 1 set
High fatigue / low performance → deload 10–15%
Pain → swap exercise & reduce load until stable
Squat → leg press / hack squat / split squat
Bench → DB press / weighted pushups / machine press
Deadlift → RDL / trap bar / rack pull
Pullups → lat pulldown / chest-supported row

Numbers over adjectives
No hype or “motivation”
Always progression-oriented
